Single quotes for string constants, double quotes for table/column names
```
select * from "employee" where "employee_name"='elina';
```
A string constant in SQL is an arbitrary sequence of characters bounded by single quotes ('), for example 'This is a string'. 
To include a single-quote character within a string constant, write two adjacent single quotes, e.g., 
'Dianne''s horse'. Note that this is not the same as a double-quote character (").

Unquoted names are case-incensitive.

thusï¼Œyou had better not use capital letter when creating table/column name. If you use capital letter, you should use double quotes 
to access them.
